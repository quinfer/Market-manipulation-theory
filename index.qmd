## How Trader Activity Informs Market Prices

- Price discovery process
  - Collective actions of buyers and sellers
- Supply and demand dynamics
  - Interaction between supply and demand drives price movements
- Role of market participants
  - Liquidity traders: Trade based on liquidity needs, not price expectations
  - Market makers: Provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices
  - Speculators (informed traders): Trade based on beliefs about the true value of a security

## Paradox of Markets

- High trading volume despite the logic that traders should refuse to transact with willing counterparties
- Liquidity traders create incentives for market makers to provide liquidity
- Market makers hope to recover losses from informed traders through transactions with liquidity traders
- Trading volumes comprise liquidity traders, market makers, and speculators
