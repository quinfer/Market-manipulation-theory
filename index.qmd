### Econ 101 View

- **Supply and Demand Dynamics**
  - Supply: Sellers willing to sell at various price points
  - Demand: Buyers willing to buy at various price points
  - Equilibrium price: Where supply meets demand

### The Trading Paradox

![](paradox_2traders.png){width="60%"}

:::{.incremental}
- High trading volume seems paradoxical
  - Rational traders should be skeptical of willing counterparties
  - "Why is the other party willing to trade with me?"
- Yet, we observe high turnover in financial markets
- This paradox challenges our understanding of price formation

## Resolution: Three Key Market Participants

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
![](market_participants.png){align="center"}
:::
::: {.column .smaller-text .incremental}
1. **Liquidity Traders**
   - Trade for non-information reasons (e.g., cash needs, rebalancing)
   - Willing to pay transaction costs to meet trading needs

2. **Market Makers**
   - Provide liquidity by always being willing to buy or sell
   - Profit from the bid-ask spread
   - Lose to informed traders, but recover losses from liquidity traders

3. **Speculators (Informed Traders)**
   - Trade based on information or analysis
   - Profit from trading against less informed participants

:::
:::


## The Three-Legged Stool of Market Function

:::{.incremental}
- Each participant type is crucial, like legs of a stool:
  - Without market makers: No consistent counterparty
  - Without liquidity traders: Market makers would exit
  - Without speculators: Prices may not reflect information

- This interaction resolves the trading paradox
  - Liquidity traders create initial demand for trading
  - Market makers provide necessary liquidity
  - Speculators ensure prices reflect available information
:::

## Price Formation Process

:::{.incremental}
- Liquidity traders initiate trades based on non-information needs
- Market makers set bid-ask spreads to balance risks
- Speculators trade when they perceive mispricing
- Interaction of all three groups leads to price discovery
- Prices continuously adjust as new information becomes available
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}

- Result: Prices reflect a balance of information and liquidity needs
:::
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
- Trading volume is driven by the interaction of all three participant types

## How Trader Activity Informs Market Prices: 

### A Model
 
- @glosten1985bid model was designed to study the impact of insider trading on market pricing and liquidity
- **Key insights:**
  - Presence of informed traders (insiders) affects bid-ask spreads
  - Market makers widen spreads to compensate for adverse selection risk
  - Insider activity can move prices to the bid or ask

## Glosten-Milgrom Model Simulation

- Demonstrates the impact of informed trading on prices and spreads
- User inputs:
  - Number of traders
  - Number of insiders
  - Number of trading rounds

- App logic:
  - Generates insider orders (biased) and noise orders
  - Calculates bid-ask spread based on insider proportion  
  - Determines price based on order imbalance
  - Outputs price series and bid-ask spread series

## Using the Glosten-Milgrom Model to Understand Market Manipulation

- Information-based manipulation
  - Manipulator acts as "insider" with false information edge
  - Creates artificial information asymmetry to mislead traders

- Spoofing and layering
  - Manipulator places orders to create false demand/supply
  - Drives price to bid or ask, then reverses position

- Wash trading  
  - Manipulator trades with self to generate artificial volume
  - Appears as high "insider" activity, widening spreads

- Collusion and pooling
  - Manipulators coordinate to act as a large informed trader
  - Model suggests higher informed trading leads to wider spreads, more price impact

## Limitations

- Glosten-Milgrom model assumptions:
  - Insiders trade on genuine information
  - Doesn't fully capture complex manipulation tactics

- Extending the model:  
  - Explicitly model manipulative strategies
  - Incorporate cross-market effects
  - Consider regulatory detection and enforcement

- Empirical testing:
  - Validate model predictions using real manipulation cases
  - Assess effectiveness of the model in detecting manipulation

## EXTRAS

### Glosten Milgrom Mathematical Exposition {.smallest-text}

- $V$: The true value of the asset, which can be either low ($V_L$) or high ($V_H$)
- $P_t$: The market maker's price at time $t$
- $X_t$: The trade indicator at time $t$ (+1 for a buy, -1 for a sell)
- $\mu$: The fraction of informed traders in the market
- $\lambda$: The probability that an informed trader observes $V_H$

The model assumes that:

1. Informed traders buy when $V = V_H$ and sell when $V = V_L$
2. Uninformed traders buy and sell with equal probability

Given these assumptions, the market maker's pricing rule is:

$P_t = E[V | X_1, X_2, ..., X_{t-1}]$

This means that the market maker sets the price equal to the expected value of the asset conditional on the history of trades.

Using Bayes' rule, we can express the price as:

$P_t = \frac{P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_{t-1} | V = V_H) \cdot P(V = V_H)}{P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_{t-1})}$

The bid-ask spread at time $t$ is given by:

$S_t = P_t^a - P_t^b = \frac{\mu(1 - \lambda)}{\mu(1 - \lambda) + (1 - \mu)/2} (V_H - V_L)$

where $P_t^a$ is the ask price and $P_t^b$ is the bid price.

The key insights from this formalization are:

1. The market maker's price is a function of the trading history, reflecting the information content of past trades
2. The bid-ask spread is directly proportional to the fraction of informed traders $\mu$ and the asset's value uncertainty $(V_H - V_L)$
3. As the fraction of informed traders increases, the bid-ask spread widens to compensate for the increased adverse selection risk faced by the market maker

- This formulation provides a rigorous foundation for understanding how informed trading affects market pricing and liquidity in the Glosten-Milgrom model.
