## Market manipulation theory

Market manipulation strategies can loses be decomposed into quote-driven and transaction-driven sub-strategies.  Using quotes or orders aims artificially influence the mircostructure orderflow patterns while transactions or trades exploit artificial created , while the latter exploits undisclosed information to buy or sell securitues advantageously.  

The methods include:

- **Spoofing:** This involves placing large orders to create a false impression of market interest, then cancelling them before execution. Here are some publications concerning spoofing

  Spoofing and its Regulation


   Merritt B Fox, Lawrence R Glosten, Sue S Guan


    Nearly a century after the United States enacted its first securities laws, urgent questions remain as to the scope of manipulation law: whether manipulation is possible in principle, and if so, how the law should respond in practice. Sharp disagreement among courts, economists, and legal scholars as to whether trading or quoting activity constitutes illegal manipulation has led to a legal framework that lacks precision and cogency. Moreover, the poorly articulated normative basis for court rulings has resulted in enforcement that is both under-inclusive and over-inclusive in ways that do a poor job of discouraging socially harmful transactions and enabling socially beneficial ones.   This Article seeks to clarify this confusion. Drawing on microstructure and financial economics, this Article offers a new understanding of a common kind of quote-driven manipulation, often referred to as “spoofing.” By employing an analytical and normative framework developed previously by two of the authors in assessing another major form of manipulation, trade-driven manipulation, this Article assesses the impact of spoofing on what occurs in

The result is a new understanding of quote-based manipulation that helps resolve essential questions in manipulation law and provides guidance for future regulation and enforcement.

    Unravelling the JPMorgan spoofing case using particle physics visualization methods


    Philippe Debie, Cornelis Gardebroek, Stephan Hageboeck, Paul Leeuwen, Lorenzo Moneta, Axel Naumann, Joost M. E. Pennings, Andres A. Trujillo‐Barrera, Marjolein E. Verhulst


    On 29 September 2020, JPMorgan was ordered to pay a settlement of $920.2 million for spoofing the metals and Treasury futures markets from 2008 to 2016. We examine these cases using a visualization method developed in particle physics (CERN) and the messages that the exchange receives about market activity rather than time‐based snapshots. This approach allows to examine multiple indicators related to market manipulation and complement existing research methods, thereby enhancing the identification and understanding of, as well as the motivation for, market manipulation. In the JPMorgan cases, we offer an alternative motivation for spoofing than moving the price.

    Algos gone wild: What drives the extreme order cancellation rates in modern markets?


    Marta Khomyn, Tālis J. Putniņš


    97% of orders in US stock markets are cancelled before they trade, straining market infrastructure and raising concerns about predatory or manipulative trading. To understand the drivers of these extreme cancellation rates, we develop a simple model of liquidity provision and find that growth in order-to-trade ratios (OTTRs) is driven by fragmentation of trading and technological improvements that lower monitoring costs. High OTTRs occur legitimately in stocks with high volatility, fragmented trading, small tick sizes, and low volume. OTTRs are usually within levels consistent with market making, but occasionally spike to levels that may indicate illegitimate trading such as spoofing.

- **cross-market spoofing:** In this method, a trader places a large number of orders on one market to manipulate the price, while simultaneously placing opposite orders on another market to profit from the price movement. This can also be by placing a resting order and a spoofing order in different markets.



    Cross-market spoofing


    Alexis Stenfors, Mehrdaad Doraghi, Cristina Soviany, Masayuki Susai, Kaveh Vakili


    Since 2012, regulatory investigations have revealed widespread manipulation and collusive practices among banks active in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. These discoveries have resulted in fines and settlements amounting to billions of US dollars, criminal proceedings and stricter regulation worldwide. However, recent legal cases and regulatory reports indicate that authorities have stepped up their efforts to crack down on so-called “cross-market spoofing”. The manipulative tactic involves a combination of a genuine order in one market and a spoof order in another, which is notoriously difficult to detect. In this paper, we use a high-frequency data set of limit order book snapshots from the foreign exchange (FX) spot market to develop and test a methodology to assess the feasibility, and hence potential prevalence, of cross-market spoofing. Our findings show that predictable reactions follow potential single-market spoofs that a market manipulator may exploit. Crucially, we also find that predictability may be observed in closely related markets. In particular, we discover that EUR/JPY offers a reliable pathway for a manipulator to exploit via spoof orders at deeper levels in the EUR/USD or USD/JPY limit order books. The findings suggest that a manipulator is more likely to submit a spoof order in a liquid market and a resting order in a less liquid but closely related market, rather than vice versa. Moreover, cross-market spoof orders are more likely to be found in markets that act as hedging markets.

- **Quote Stuffing:** In this method, a large number of orders are rapidly placed and withdrawn to create confusion in the market.



    Quote Stuffing


    Jared F Egginton, Bonnie F Van Ness, Robert A Van Ness


    In this study we examine intense episodic spikes in quoting activity (frequently referred to as quote stuffing) on market conditions. We find that quote stuffing is pervasive and that over 74% of US exchange‐listed securities experienced at least one episode during 2010. We also find that stocks experience decreased liquidity, higher trading costs, and increased short‐term volatility during periods of intense quoting activity. We find that most quote‐stuffing events occur on the NYSE, ARCA, NASDAQ, and BATS and that during these quote‐stuffing events, the number of new orders and canceled orders increases substantially while the order size and order duration decrease .

- **Pump and Dump:** This is where misleading information is spread to inflate a stock's price, followed by selling off the stock at a profit.

- **Wash Trading:** This involves a trader buying their own order to create artificial activity in the marketplace.

- **Churning:** Here, a broker repeatedly buys and sells stocks for the primary purpose of generating commission fees.

- **Cornering the Market:** This is where a trader acquires enough shares of a specific asset to gain control of its market price.

- **Insider Trading:** This involves trading based on non-public, material information.

- **Ponzi Scheme:** This is a fraudulent investment scheme where returns are paid to earlier investors using funds from more recent investors, rather than from actual profits. The scheme eventually collapses when there 

- **Front-running:** This is when a broker or trader executes orders on their own behalf before executing orders for their clients, taking advantage of the price movement caused by their clients’ orders.

- **Layering:** This involves placing multiple orders on one side of the market to create a false impression of supply or demand, while simultaneously placing a large order on the other side of the market.

    Comparisons of machine learning techniques for detecting fraudulent criminal identities


    Hassan Kazemian, Subeksha Shrestha


    This paper focuses on applications of various machine learning techniques on an anonymized policing dataset used in EU SPIRIT Horizon 2020 project to identify fraudulent identities and help Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in their investigation in finding potential criminals and identity resolution. Lack of qualitative data and appropriate methodology to carry out research on criminal fraudulent identities is a common reason for fewer research in this area. Additionally, it is a very sensitive data to work with and minor inaccuracy in prediction of result causes massive impact in the society as genuine people could be questioned whereas criminals could be sent free. Both of these issues are addressed in this paper by application of 39 million records from policing dataset and working towards higher accuracy while building the model. Various machine learning approaches are applied to train the dataset to make predictions and the research focus on being able to predict the 5 suspected fraudulent identities out of 39 million records in the policing dataset. One of the applied machine learning techniques include TensorFlow along with Keras model which has seldomly been applied by researchers in detection of criminal data. To compare the results and test accuracy of TensorFlow model, other machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes and K-nearest Neighbours are also applied to have a comparative study on the obtained outcomes from each model. The goal of this research is to find fraudulent IDs amongst all the anonymized IDs in the criminal dataset using TensorFlow and three other machine learning models and select the most optimal model out of them. Since the model is comparing two names so string-matching techniques such as Levenshtein edit distance, Hamming Distance, Jaro-Winkler and Soundex were applied to select an effective approach first before building the model and analysing the results. TensorFlow model demonstrated highest accuracy with relatively least execution time and the only model to successfully predict all the 5 suspects from the policing dataset.

    An Adversarial Approach to Structural Estimation


    Tetsuya Kaji, Elena Manresa, Guillaume Pouliot


    We propose a new simulation‐based estimation method, adversarial estimation, for structural models. The estimator is formulated as the solution to a minimax problem between a generator (which generates simulated observations using the structural model) and a discriminator (which classifies whether an observation is simulated). The discriminator maximizes the accuracy of its classification while the generator minimizes it. We show that, with a sufficiently rich discriminator, the adversarial estimator attains parametric efficiency under correct specification and the parametric rate under misspecification. We advocate the use of a neural network as a discriminator that can exploit adaptivity properties and attain fast rates of convergence.
