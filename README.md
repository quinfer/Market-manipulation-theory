## Market Manipulation Theory

Market manipulation strategies can be categorized into **quote-driven** and **transaction-driven** sub-strategies. Quote-driven strategies involve using quotes or orders to artificially influence order flow patterns, while transaction-driven strategies exploit undisclosed information to advantageously buy or sell securities.

### Quote-Driven Manipulation Methods

*   **Spoofing:** Placing large orders to create a false impression of market interest, then canceling them before execution. 
*   **Cross-Market Spoofing:** Placing a large order in one market to manipulate the price while simultaneously placing an opposite order in another market to profit. Alternatively, placing a resting order in one market and a spoofing order in another.
*   **Quote Stuffing:** Rapidly placing and withdrawing a large number of orders to create market confusion.

### Transaction-Driven Manipulation Methods

*   **Pump and Dump:** Spreading misleading information to inflate a stock's price before selling at a profit.
*   **Wash Trading:** Buying and selling the same security to create artificial trading activity.
*   **Churning:** A broker excessively trading a client's account to generate commissions.
*   **Cornering the Market:** Acquiring enough shares of a security to control its market price.
*   **Insider Trading:** Trading based on non-public, material information.
*   **Ponzi Scheme:** A fraudulent investment scheme where returns are paid to earlier investors with funds from newer investors.
*   **Front-Running:** A broker executing orders for their own account before executing client orders to profit from the price movement.
*   **Layering:** Placing multiple orders on one side of the market to create a false impression of supply or demand while placing a large order on the other side.
